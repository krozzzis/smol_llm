# The Road to LLM 

In this repository I track progress of my NLP skills.

I don't use any dependencies in this projects. 
All subprojects will made from scratch and only in Rust)).

## Roadmap
- [x] BPE Tokenizer
- [ ] Interactive tokenizer and vocab viewer in HTML/WASM
- [ ] Simple language model(e.g. using Markov chain)
- [ ] Telegram bot and HTML app for simple language model
- [ ] Simple neural network implementation
- [ ] Neural network training/inference framework
- [ ] Word embedding, word2vec
- [ ] Interactive word similarity viewer in HTML/WASM
- [ ] Text generator

## Usage

### Tokenizer

CLI tool:
```bash
$ cargo run --bin tokenizer_cli
```
